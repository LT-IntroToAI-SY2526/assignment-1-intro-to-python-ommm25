MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
[I am learnin python basics in high school programming class. I have a decent amount of experience with java. Can you create 5 practice problems
that test my soutions with different inputs, and include comments explaining your approach to the answer.]

Example: "I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. 
I have some experience with Java. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover..."

PROBLEM 1: [Problem Title/Description]
Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns "Even" if the number is even and "Odd" if the number is odd.

print(even_or_odd(4)) should be even
print(even_or_odd(3)) Should be odd
print(even_or_odd(5)) Should be odd
print(even_or_odd(8)) Should be even
print(even_or_odd(20)) Should be even 
print(even_or_odd(21)) Should be odd

Test all your solutions with different inputs

Add asserts if you feel comfortable

Example:
print("Testing Problem 1:")
print(f"is_even(4): {is_even(4)}")  # Should print True
print(f"is_even(7): {is_even(7)}")  # Should print False
